This is my new "working blog" inspired by [homoiconic](https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic).

The focus here is on providing working code that can be downloaded, compiled and run by the reader while also providing supporting text, in the form of a blog post, that helps to illustrate how the code works.  That is, it's pretty much the same as a traditional blog but with an emphasis on complete, working code examples rather than simply just code excerpts.

I titled the blog _try try try_ after a verse in the song _12341234_ from the Album [Keasbey Nights](http://www.amazon.com/Keasbey-Nights-Catch-22/dp/B000005ZFF/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1301883715&sr=1-1) by New Jersey Ska band Catch 22.  It reminds me of a great quote from \_Why that has resonated with me at such a deep level and has reminded me that the most important thing you can do in anything you want to be good at is to try.
