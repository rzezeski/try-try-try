Riak Core, The vnode
==========

If you're new to Riak Core you should read my previous post about [multinode](https://github.com/rzezeski/try-try-try/tree/master/2011/riak-core-first-multinode) first to see how to create a project skeleton.

In this post I will implement an application I'm calling Real Time Statistics (RTS for short) which will accept log entries over HTTP and generate real-time statistics from those entries.  I will focus on the _vnode_ which is the workhorse of a Riak Core application.  You should follow along by cloning this repo and looking at the RTS code as you read this.


An Interview Question
----------

I was recently posed with an interview question that went something like this:

> You have N machines writing syslog events to a server somewhere.  Each incoming entry should be compared to a list of regular expressions on the server.  Each regexp has a corresponding event that should be triggered if a match occurs.  Said event will write/update a value somewhere that can be queried by interested parties.  How do you implement it?

My RTS system is designed to solve this problem, except I'm swapping syslog for anything that can write over HTTP.  You could even use a named pipe and netstat to send your syslog events.  There are two problems to solve.  First,  parsing the incoming entries and triggering functions when a match occurs.  This will be handled by the [entry vnode](https://github.com/rzezeski/try-try-try/blob/master/2011/riak-core-the-vnode/rts/src/rts_entry_vnode.erl).  Second, accepting and persisting statistics generated by the triggered functions.  The stats will be handled by the [stat vnode](https://github.com/rzezeski/try-try-try/blob/master/2011/riak-core-the-vnode/rts/src/rts_stat_vnode.erl).  I'll be using entries from access logs in [combined log format](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#combined) as my sample data.


What's a vnode, Anyways?
----------

* A vnode is a _virtual node_, as opposed to physical node

* Each vnode is responsible for **one** partition on the [ring](http://wiki.basho.com/An-Introduction-to-Riak.html#Clustering)

* A vnode is an [Erlang process](http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/processes.html)

* A vnode is a [behavior](http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/fsm.html) written atop of the _gen\_fsm_  behavior

* A vnode handles incoming requests

* A vnode potentially stores data to be retrieved later

* A vnode is _the_ unit of concurrency, replication, and fault tolerance

* Typically many vnodes will run on each physical node

* Each machine has a _vnode master_ who's purpose is to keep track of all active vnodes on its node

As you can see a vnode takes on a lot of responsibility.  Luckily, the good folks at Basho have already done most of the heavy lifting by providing a [vnode behavior](https://github.com/basho/riak_core/blob/master/src/riak_core_vnode.erl) which you code to.  If Erlang is like a foreign language to you than think of a _behavior_ like an _interface_ in that it declares callback functions that you must implement.  Furthermore, it provides a _container_ which implements the semantics of the behavior and makes calls into your callback module.  Kind of like how J2EE provides a web container and you simply code a Servlet, except way cooler.  By coding to a behavior you are free to focus on the problem you need to solve rather than how to implement a vnode.  That said, you can't do much if you don't understand the inputs and outputs of these callbacks.  That's why you're reading this.


Life-cycle Callbacks
----------

The `init/1` and `terminate/2` callbacks are called at the edges of
the vnode life-cycle.  When a pid linked to the vnode crashes the
`handle_exit/3` callback will be invoked.

### init([Index]) -> Result ###

    Index       :: int() >= 0
    Result      :: {ok, State}
    State       :: term()

This callback initializes the state of the vnode.  My entry vnode needs to store the regexp to trigger fun mapping so that the command callback can access it later.

    init([Partition]) ->
        Reg = [
               {?COMBINED_LF, fun ?MODULE:combined_lf/2}
              ],
        {ok, #state { partition=Partition, reg=Reg }}.

My stat vnode needs to track the stat updates as they are sent in.

    init([Partition]) ->
        {ok, #state { partition=Partition, stats=dict:new() }}.

### terminate(Reason, State) -> Result ###

    Reason      :: normal | shutdown | {shutdown, term()} | term()
    State       :: term()
    Result      :: term()

Used to cleanup any resources held by the vnode.  The `Reason` will depend on how the vnode was stopped.  Since the vnode container is simply a _gen\_fsm_ underneath you can read more about the `Reason` [here](http://erldocs.com/R14B/stdlib/gen_fsm.html).  The `State` is the final state of the vnode and `Result` can be anything but will be ignored by the container.

Since both the entry and stat vnodes keep everything in memory Erlang will handle cleanup implicitly and there is nothing explicit to be done in terminate.

    terminate(_Reason, _State) ->
        ok.


### handle_exit(Pid, Reason, State) -> Result ###

    Pid         :: pid()
    Reason      :: term()
    State       :: term()
    Result      :: {noreply, NewState}
                 | {stop, NewState}

When a process linked to the vnode dies this callback will be invoked
with the `Pid` of the crashed process along with the `Reason` for the
crash and the vnode's current `State`.  At this point you have two
choices.

1. The linked `Pid` is vital to the functioning of the vnode so you
return `{stop, NewState}` to bring the vnode down as well.

2. The linked `Pid` isn't vital so you log a warning and return
`{noreply, NewState}` to allow the vnode to continue execution.


Commands
----------

All incoming requests become commands on your vnode.  For example, a _GET_ on Riak KV will end up in the [handle_command](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/blob/1.0/src/riak_kv_vnode.erl#L259) defined in its vnode.  For this reason, it might be easiest to start with the question:

> What commands will I need to implement?

To implement a command you add a new `handle_command/3` [function clause](http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/functions.html) that matches against the incoming request.  For example, to get a stat the request will be `{get, StatName}` which would require a function head with the form `handle_command({get, StatName}, ...)`.

### handle_command(Request, Sender, State) -> Result ###

    Request     :: term()
    Sender      :: sender()
    State       :: term()
    NewState    :: term()
    Result      :: {reply, Reply, NewState}
                 | {noreply, NewState}
                 | {stop, Reason, NewState}

The `Request` can be anything (i.e. any term) but is typically a _tagged tuple_.  The `Sender` is a representation of the client process but is typically used as an opaque value that you would use with a utility function such as `riak_core_vnode:reply/2`.  The `State` is much like state in a _gen\_server_ and is there to track data across callback invocations.

There are three choices of reply.  In all cases the 3rd element of the tuple is the potentially modified state.

1) _reply_: Send `Reply` back to the client.

2) _noreply_: Don't send a reply.  This doesn't necessarily indicate that no reply was made, it just means you don't want the vnode container to send a reply.  For example, this command could cause a long-running action to occur and you might spawn it on another process passing the `Sender`.

3) _stop_: For whatever `Reason` you want this vnode to terminate.

The entry vnode needs to compare each incoming log entry with all registered regular expressions and possibly execute a corresponding trigger fun.

    handle_command({entry, Client, Entry}, _Sender, #state{reg=Reg}=State) ->
        io:format("~p~n", [{entry, State#state.partition}]),
        lists:foreach(match(Client, Entry), Reg),
        {noreply, State}.

With the `match/2` HOF defined as so.

    match(Client, Entry) ->
        fun({Regexp, Fun}) ->
                case re:run(Entry, Regexp, [{capture, all, list}]) of
                    nomatch -> ignore;
                    {match, Match} -> Fun({Client, Entry, Regexp}, Match)
                end
        end.

The stat vnode is like a mini [redis](http://redis.io/) in that it offers in-place updates.  Notice that all mutations cause a new state to be created and returned.

    handle_command({get, StatName}, _Sender, #state{stats=Stats}=State) ->
        Reply =
            case dict:find(StatName, Stats) of
                error ->
                    not_found;
                Found ->
                    Found
            end,
        {reply, Reply, State};

    handle_command({set, StatName, Val}, _Sender, #state{stats=Stats0}=State) ->
        Stats = dict:store(StatName, Val, Stats0),
        {reply, ok, State#state{stats=Stats}};

    handle_command({incr, StatName}, _Sender, #state{stats=Stats0}=State) ->
        Stats = dict:update_counter(StatName, 1, Stats0),
        {reply, ok, State#state{stats=Stats}};

    handle_command({incrby, StatName, Val}, _Sender, #state{stats=Stats0}=State) ->
        Stats = dict:update_counter(StatName, Val, Stats0),
        {reply, ok, State#state{stats=Stats}};

    handle_command({append, StatName, Val}, _Sender, #state{stats=Stats0}=State) ->
        Stats = try dict:append(StatName, Val, Stats0)
                catch _:_ -> dict:store(StatName, [Val], Stats0)
                end,
        {reply, ok, State#state{stats=Stats}};

    handle_command({sadd, StatName, Val}, _Sender, #state{stats=Stats0}=State) ->
        F = fun(S) ->
                    sets:add_element(Val, S)
            end,
        Stats = dict:update(StatName, F, sets:from_list([Val]), Stats0),
        {reply, ok, State#state{stats=Stats}}.


"Covering" Commands
----------

In 1.0 the idea of a "covering" command was added to the core vnode
abstraction.  The `handle_coverage/4` callback along with a
corresponding coverage behavior implementation allows you to implement
a command that "covers" the entire key space.  For example, this is
used to implement Riak's list keys operation as well as range queries
for secondary indices.  Note, this is **NOT** pulling the objects out
first.  It passes the operation all the way down to the vnode which
means it can stay very efficient.  This opens up the door for other
cool things like a native range operation that would allow you to
perform a range query on the primary key and get back the **objects**
that match that range; and it would be done in an efficient manner
when using an ordered backend like leveldb.

In the future I'll be writing a dedicated post on implementing a
coverage command but for now you'll have to look at the code.


Handoff
----------

A _handoff_ occurs when a vnode realizes it's not on the proper node.  This will happen when a) the ring has changed because of addition/removal of a node or b) a node comes alive after it has been down.  Riak Core implements _hinted handoff_.  The "hint" is a piece of data that tells the partition where its proper home is.  Periodically a "home check" is done which uses the hint to determine if the vnode is on the correct physical host.  If it isn't, then it will go into handoff mode transfering its data to the correct vnode.

Implementing handoff seems hard on the surface but it's nothing to be afraid of.  The key thing to remember about handoff is its purpose is to transfer data from one vnode to another.  Data transfer, that's it.  This means that you don't have to implement handoff if your vnode is purely computational.  Well, you should write the callbacks but they won't have to do anything.

The players in handoff are `is_empty/1`, `delete/1`, `handoff_starting/2`, `handoff_cancelled/1`, `encode_handoff_item/2`, `handle_handoff_data/2`, `handle_handoff_command/3`, and `handoff_finished/2`.

### is_empty(State) -> Result ###

    State       :: term()
    NewState    :: term()
    Result      :: {true, NewState}
                 | {false, NewState}

Once the container has determined a vnode is out of place its first action is determine if there is any data to be transferred.  If there is then return _true_ otherwise return _false_.  When a vnode is deemed empty the `delete/3` callback will be invoked.

The stat vnode checks the size of the `stats` dict to determine if it's empty.

    is_empty(State) ->
        case dict:size(State#state.stats) of
            0 -> {true, State};
            _ -> {false, State}
        end.

### delete(State) -> Result ###

    State       :: term()
    NewState    :: term()
    Result      :: {ok, NewState}

The container will invoke this callback when it's determined there is no more data to be transferred.  That is, when `is_empty/1` returns _true_.  Use this time to perform any preemptive cleanup of vnode resources.  On return the vnode will be terminated with a `Reason` of `normal` and the `terminate/2` callback will have a chance to make any final cleanup.

### handoff_starting(TargetNode, State) -> Result ###

    TargetNode  :: node()
    Result      :: {true, NewState} | {false, NewState}
    State       :: term()
    NewState    :: term()

Invoked by the container when it's determined a handoff must occur.  The vnode has the final say in whether or not the handoff will occur.  Return _true_ to continue and _false_ to cancel.  A vnode might have some heuristic that determines its load and choose not to participate in handoff if overloaded at the moment.  The `TargetNode` is the node to transfer the data to.

### handoff_cancelled(State) -> Result ###

    State       :: term()
    NewState    :: term()
    Result      :: {ok, NewState}

The _handoff manager_ allows a set number of concurrent handoff operations.  By default it's 4 but this can be adjusted.  If it's determined that the maximum concurrency has been reached then the container will invoke this callback.  You could use this to undo anything you might have done in `handoff_starting/2`.

This callback is also invoked if an error occured during handoff.

### encode_handoff_item(K, V) -> Result ###

    K           :: {Bucket, Key}
    Bucket      :: riak_object:bucket()
    Key         :: riak_object:key()
    V           :: term()
    Result      :: binary()

It seems there are still remnants of Riak KV leftover in Riak Core.  Notice the notion of bucket/key and their types.  I think the more general contract is that `K` should be a two-tuple and `V` can be anything.  That said, this callback is used by the container to encode data before crossing the wire.  I.e., it serializes the data.  To get this right you have to know three things:

1) Encode both `K` and `V` together, i.e. they need to go across together.

2) This function must return a binary.

3) This works in concert with `handle_handoff_data/2`.

To encode a stat I simply make a two-tuple with the name and value and convert to [external format](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html) via `term_to_binary/1`.

    encode_handoff_item(StatName, Val) ->
        term_to_binary({StatName,Val}).

### handle_handoff_data(BinObj, State) -> Result ###

    BinObj      :: binary()
    State       :: term()
    NewState    :: term()
    Result      :: {reply, ok, NewState}
                 | {reply, {error, Error}, NewState}

This callback deserializes handoff data as it comes across.  It's job is to reconstruct the vnode state from the `BinObj` binaries.  If there is a problem decoding the data then reply with `{error, Error}` that describes the failure.

To decode a stat I unwrap it with `binary_to_term/1` and insert it into the local dict.

    handle_handoff_data(Data, #state{stats=Stats0}=State) ->
        {StatName, Val} = binary_to_term(Data),
        Stats = dict:store(StatName, Val, Stats0),
        {reply, ok, State#state{stats=Stats}}.


### handle_handoff_command(Request, Sender, State) -> Result ###

    Request     :: term()
    Sender      :: sender()
    State       :: term()
    NewState    :: term()
    Result      :: {reply, Reply, NewState}
                 | {noreply, NewState}
                 | {forward, NewState}
                 | {drop, NewState}
                 | {stop, Reason, NewState}

This callback is very similar to `handle_command/3` but is instead invoked when a request is received **during** handoff.  It has two additional possible return types as well: _forward_ and _drop_.  The _forward_ reply will send the request to the target node.  The _drop_ reply will exhibit the same behavior as noreply but is used to signify that you are "dropping" this request on the floor.  That is, you won't even attempt to fulfill it.

If you want your vnode to handoff data properly then you have to implement the `?FOLD_REQ` in `handle_handoff_command/3`.  You need to do this because this is the method by which the _handoff manager_ iterates over your data.  `?FOLD_REQ` is a macro for the `#riak_core_fold_req_v1` record which contains a `foldfun` and `acc0` (accumulator) element.  The `foldfun` expects to be passed three arguments: the key, value, and accumulator.  This means that if your data structure doesn't already support this form of fold function you'll have to wrap it.  For example, if your data was in a proplist you would write a wrapper function to convert each two-tuple into two separate arguments.

    F = fun({Key,Val}, Acc) -> FoldFun(Key, Val, Acc) end,
    Acc = lists:foldl(F, Acc0, State#state.data),
    ...

In the case of the stat vnode I'm using a [dict](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dict.html) and it naturally supports a 3-arg fold function.  The accumulator is an opaque value and is used to keep track of the socket and trigger sync commands periodically.  See the [handoff sender](https://github.com/basho/riak_core/blob/1.0/src/riak_core_handoff_sender.erl) if you're really curious.  Finally, make sure to return the final value of the accumulator.  You can see just how easy this is by looking at what I did in the stat vnode.

    handle_handoff_command(?FOLD_REQ{foldfun=Fun, acc0=Acc0}, _Sender, State) ->
        Acc = dict:fold(Fun, Acc0, State#state.stats),
        {reply, Acc, State}.

I do wonder if this fold request should have been its own callback in the vnode behavior, but that's discussion for another day.


### handoff_finished(TargetNode, State) -> Result ###

    TargetNode  :: node()
    Result      :: any()
    State       :: term()

This callback is invoked when all data has been successfully handed
off to the `TargetNode`.  The `Result` can be anything and is ignored
by the container.


Using RTS
----------

Now it's time to see it in action.  You'll need to download the RTS project, compile it, and make a release.

    git clone git://github.com/rzezeski/try-try-try.git
    cd try-try-try/2011/riak-core-the-vnode/rts
    make rel

Start the console.

    ./rel/rts/bin/rts console

Open another terminal window and run the `replay` script with either my provided access log or your own.  Remember, the log must be in combined log format.

    gunzip -c progski.access.log.gz | ./replay progski

You should see a bunch of two-tuple's fly by in the console.  This is showing the vnode's index (partition) that the incoming entry is being handled on.  Notice how the number is constantly changing, this shows that work is being distributed.  Keep in mind this won't be the fastest cause it's a new HTTP connection for each entry.  I'm thinking of implementing persistent connections for a future post.

After the script has finished (or kill it early if you want, it won't hurt anything) go back to the console and ask for some stats.

    (rts@127.0.0.1)2> rts:get("progski", "total_reqs").
    {ok,10809}

    (rts@127.0.0.1)3> rts:get("progski", "GET").
    {ok,10485}

    (rts@127.0.0.1)4> rts:get("progski", "HEAD").
    {ok,324}

    (rts@127.0.0.1)5> rts:get("progski", "PUT").
    not_found

    {ok, Agents} = rts:get("progski", "agents").
    sets:to_list(Agents).

Now lets turn it up a notch test this systems supposed "real time" moniker.  First, delete the `io:format` call in the entry vnode, recompile, and then build a devrel.

    make && make devrel

Now start your nodes and join them.

    for d in dev/dev*; do $d/bin/rts start; done
    for d in dev/dev*; do $d/bin/rts ping; done
    for d in dev/dev{2,3}; do $d/bin/rts-admin join rts1@127.0.0.1; done
    ./dev/dev1/bin/rts-admin ringready

Now run replay with the `--devrel` option.

    gunzip -c progski.access.log.gz | ./replay --devrel progski

If you open up `top` or some other similar process monitoring tool you should see all three beam processes doing some work.  It won't be any faster than one node because the overhead is probably in setup/teardown of the HTTP connection but it demonstrates that work is being distributed among multiple nodes.  Disable the tty handler so that error msgs don't mess with your console.

    error_logger:delete_report_handler(error_logger_tty_h).

Now ask for stats while the entries are flowing in.  There ya go, real time statistics.


Where's The Redundancy?
----------

The keen readers out there might have noticed that the stat vnode has no redundancy.  That's right, there's none there.  Follow the code path from entry request to writing of the stat, you'll find no code that copies the data.  If you start taking down nodes you'll find that stats start to disappear.

When using Riak Core you must remember that it's a _tool_ for writing distributed systems and it doesn't do everything for you.  In my next post I will talk about the idea of coordination and I'll write a stat coordinator for the RTS application.


Other Examples
----------

Current examples of [Riak Core](https://github.com/basho/riak_core)  in action include [Riak KV](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv) (also just called Riak), [Riak Search](https://github.com/basho/riak_search) and [BashoBanjo](https://github.com/rustyio/BashoBanjo).  The first two are actual products created and supported by Basho and the third is just something really cool that Rusty Klophaus did.
